3. How do different outlets perform in terms of sales segmented by fat content, and what are the trends in other KPIs?  
4. How does the age or type of outlet establishment influence total sales over time?  
5. How does outlet size correlate with total sales?  
6. What is the geographic distribution of sales across outlet locations?  
7. How do all key metrics vary by outlet type?
